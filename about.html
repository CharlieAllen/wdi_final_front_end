          <p>TED talks are a wonderful resource for inspiration and learning, but there are so many that it can sometimes be a little difficult to find the ones you love.</p>
          <p>TED Chat enables you to easily search through available talks using keywords of your choice.  You can either just watch and enjoy, or if you'd like to keep a record of your favourites simply create an account and then you can enjoy your favourite talks any time, easily!</p>
